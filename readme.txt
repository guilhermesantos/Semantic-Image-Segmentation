The aim of this project is to investigate the implementation and the applications of semantic segmentation via deep learning models. We will attempt to build and train a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) from scratch, as well as compare it to pretrained models and other CNN architectures. Finally, we will explore different applications, such as medical image segmentation and autonomous driving.
